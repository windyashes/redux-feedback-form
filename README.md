# Redux Homework Feedback Website

This website will take feedback from students on the weekend challenge assignment. It will store the answers locally with redux until they submit it, where it gets sent to the database.

## Description

I went a bit overboard with the css on this one, that, probably what took the most time. I think it looks really nice though :)
also I kind of built the website as if I was actually EDA. It made it more fun to get into character.

### I'll list some of the features of the site I like:
- If a user tries to skip a question by changing the url, they get sent back to the earliest question they left unanswered.
- The footer includes bootstrap icons with links to EDA social media pages
- The admin page has a login screen with a password
- The admin page can delete feedback as well as mark feedback for review
- All questions have different input types (radio, range, select, textarea)
- The success screen has a confetti gif background with a timer that sends you back to the home page when finished :)
- I used background patterns on some elements (The header is the most obvious one)
- I spent a while really nailing down a color palette, and throughout the process I used css :root variables for my colors
- I used a wide variety of bootstrap elements, components, and techniques
- A very large amount of css
